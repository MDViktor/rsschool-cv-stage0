## Key competencies:
---
    The desire that everything obeys logic motivates me to create, to act. 
    I love getting to the bottom of the truth. 
    I love mathematics, but for education I went to economics. 
    I want to fix this by becoming a programmer. 
    Today I am a printing press operator in a printing house, which gives me a good help for typesetting.
